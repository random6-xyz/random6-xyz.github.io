## My previous blog

I've been using a service that deploys notion pages with custom domain. It was convenient, but it was costly for me. So I unsubscribe from that service and move to github-pages and jekyll. Now I am satisfied. Because it is free and pretty stylish.

## Now my blog

I'm going to use this blog more often. I want to post more than one post per week. I want to post my daily life and my tech project.
